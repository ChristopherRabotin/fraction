# Change Log


## [0.3.0] - 2016-11-15
### Added
- From<(N, D)> generic implementation (through std::fmt::Display)

### Changed
- GenericFraction<T> copy semantic to be applied only when `T: Clone`
- GenericFraction impl, constructors refactoring (new, new_raw)
- `num` upgraded up to `0.1.36` (from `0.1.34`)

### Removed
- `fn new` does not perform type casting through fmt::Display anymore (that functionality moved out as `From<(N, D)>`)


## [0.2.2] - 2016-09-17
### Added
- `impl From<num::BigInt> for BigFraction`
- `impl From<num::BigUint> for BigFraction`


## [0.2.1] - 2016-08-28
### Changed
- Package description has been changed


## [0.2.0] - 2016-08-28
### Added
- [num crate](https://crates.io/crates/num) is a dependency now
- `GenericFraction<T>` implemented upon `num::Ratio<T>`
- `BigFraction` implementation based on `num::BigRational` (using heap)
- `num::traits::Bounded` trait implemented
- `fn min_positive_value` implemented
- `num::traits::ToPrimitive` trait implemented
- `num::traits::Signed` trait implemented
- `From<f64>` trait implementation now relies on `format!` macro instead of `f64::fract`
- `BigFraction` struct using `num::BigUint`
- `fn format_as_float` for BigFraction has been implemented

### Changed
- The codebase has been rewritten and the license has been changed from `LGPL-3` to `MIT/Apache2` dual
- no more convertions into INFINITY on arithmetic overflows
- `fn to_f64` now returns `Option<f64>` instead of `f64` (`num::trait::ToPrimitive` implementation)
- `From` trait implementation uses `fmt::Display` from now on

### Removed
- `fn unpack` removed
- `std::cmp::Ord` implementation removed in regard to `NaN` values
